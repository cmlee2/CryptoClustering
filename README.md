# CryptoClustering
This project uses Unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 hr or 7 day price changes. In this project, I prepared the data using the Standard Scaler module from scikit-learn to normalize the data. Afterwards, I found the best value for K using the elbow method by tracking the interia of the dataset as K increases. Cryptocurrencies were then clustered using the original dataset. For comparison, this was compared with clusters optimized using Principal Component Analysis. The most optimal K value was found and the data was then clustered using PCA data.

This project helps visualize the difference between datasets when using PCA. Also this project helps strengthen the skills surrounding building unsupervised learning models.
